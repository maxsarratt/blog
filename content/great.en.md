## Charity

- [Give Well](https://www.givewell.org/) - GiveWell's mission is to find outstanding giving opportunities and publish the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give. They publish a list of top charities, which are their recommendations for donors. GiveWell is focused on finding a small number of outstanding giving opportunities, not on reviewing as many charities — or as many causes — as possible.
  - [Top Charities](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities)
- [Give Directly](https://www.givedirectly.org/) - Lift one person above poverty by donating $30/mo. Direct giving is an efficient, proven, and empowering way to help.
